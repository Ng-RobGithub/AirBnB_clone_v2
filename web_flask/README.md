H1 tag: “Number: n is even|odd” inside the tag BODY
You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition

Task 7. Improve engines
mandatory
Before using Flask to display our HBNB data, you will need to update some part of our engine:

Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)

Add a public method def close(self):: call reload() method for deserializing the JSON file to objects
Update DBStorage: (models/engine/db_storage.py)

Add a public method def close(self):: call remove() method on the private session attribute (self.__session) tips or close() on the class Session tips
Update State: (models/state.py) - If it’s not already present

If your storage engine is not DBStorage, add a public getter method cities to return the list of City objects from storage linked to the current State

Task 8. List of states
mandatory
Write a script that starts a Flask web application:

Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/states_list: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
H1 tag: “States”
UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B>
Import this 7-dump to have some data
You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition
IMPORTANT

Make sure you have a running and valid setup_mysql_dev.sql in your AirBnB_clone_v2 repository (Task)
Make sure all tables are created when you run echo "quit" | HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db ./console.py
